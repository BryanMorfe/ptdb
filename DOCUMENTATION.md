### Global Functions
There are three main global functions that will help you work with PTDB.

```python
def parseString(string)
```
The above function takes a string as a parameter, and parses it for PTDB use.
This function returns a new Database Object, which later can be manipulated as needed.

```python
def parse(file)
```
Much like the last function, except that this one parses a file instead of a string. It also returns a Database Object, with the exception that the name of the file is also added into the properties of the object (the filename can be modified).

```python
def createDatabase(name)
```
This function creates an empty Database Object and returns it, to then be manipulated later. The parameter `name` is passed to be set as the filename when the file is saved.

### A little about the Ptdb Object
The Ptdb Object simply stores a column with its items in its properties.

```python
class Ptdb
```
The properties hold the title, attribute, type and a list of the items of each column.

### The Database Object
The Database Object basically handles all of the functionality of the PTDB parser, along with holding all the data.
```python
class Database
```
#### Properties
The properties of this object most likely won't be modified by the user (you), but it is useful to know them, and know how it all works together.
```python
database = []
file = ''
```
The `database` property holds a list of all the columns in the database (A list of Ptdb Objects). This is **not** to be modified, since all the methods below will do it in a more semantically correct way.

The `file` property simply holds the name of the file containing all the data, or simply a filename to be set to a new file. This property should **only** be modified if:
1. A string was parsed, but you want to save a new file.
2. If you want to change the filename of your file currently holding the data.

#### Methods
There are quite a few methods in the Database Object. After reading this section you will be familiar with PTDB and will be able to do anything you want with it.

```python
def amountOfColumns()
```
This is one of the simplest methods. It simply returns an int indication how many columns the database has.

```python
def isItemInColumn(col, item)
```
This method returns a boolean value (true or false), whether it finds the specified `item` in a specified column `col`.

```python
def getItemInColumn(col)
```
This method returns all the **items** in a specified column `col`.

```python
def getColumnType(col)
```
This method returns the type (String, Int, Float...) of a column `col`.

```python
def getColumnAttribute(col)
```
This method returns the attribute (none, ai, null) of a column `col`.

```python
def columnHasAttribute(col, attr)
```
This method returns true or false whether a specified column `col`, has an specified attribute `attr`.

```python
def getRowIndex(col, item)
```
This method returns the index of a row, where a column `col` has a value of `item`.

```python
def getColumnItem(col, index)
```
This method returns the item in a column `col`, in a specified `index`.

```python
def getDataForIndex(index)
```
This method returns all the items or data in a specified `index`.

```python
def modifyEntry(col, index, newEntry)
```
This method replaces a column `col` value in a specified `index` with a new value `newEntry`. This method will save the database if it's finished successfully.

```python
def newEntry(titles, entries)
```
This method adds a new entry with a specified **list** of `entries` to the database in a specified **list** of `titles`. They **MUST** be specified as a list, and values most be in the same position as their respective title. This method will save the database if it's finished successfully.

**Note: All columns *must* be entered in this function, *except* those with an attribute of `AI` (*must* not be added) and `NULL` (may or may not be added). Adding a column with an attribute of `AI` will cause the function to return `False` and not add *anything*.**

```python
def removeEntry(index)
```
This method will delete **permanently** all the data in a specified index. After it's done, it saves the database.

```python
def addTitle(title, type = 'STRING', attr = 'NONE')
```
This method adds a new column with the name title. This method can **only** be called if the database is new and has no data in it. The type and attr parameters can be omitted or should only be specified if the values are different from their default values.

```python
def addTitles(titles, types, attrs)
```
Unlike the last method, all the parameters are **obligatory** when executing this method. They **must** be specified as lists as each place in each list belong to each other respectfully.

```python
def saveDatabase()
```
This method simply saves the database to a file, specified in the `file` property of the object.

Those are all the methods in the Database Object. For examples on how to use them, go to the [PTDB Examples And Explanations](https://github.com/BryanMorfe/ptdb/blob/master/REFERENCE.md#ptdb-examples-and-explanations) section.

#### Understanding Column's Attributes
A column attribute--those wrapped between square braquets--give a special meaning to a column. If you want to find out a little more keep reading.
As of **now**, there only two attributes that mean something to PTDB;
* AI
* NULL

AI: Means **Auto Increment**, and much like the Auto Increment from *MySQL*, it means that each new entry that you add will be incremented by one. It is important to add that a column with the attribute of `AI`, should **always** have a type of `INT`; Example: `[AI]ID(INT)`.
**Note: Trying to add a custom value to a column with an attribute of `AI` will cause the specific method to return `False` and not work.**

NULL: This attribute is very simple. All it means to the column is that it is **allowed** to have no value.
**Note: When adding a new entry to the database, a column attribute of `NULL` is *not* necessary.**

#### PTDB Examples And Explanations
Welcome to the examples section. In this section you will see some of the methods in practice and their expanations.

Here are some examples using PTDB and their explanations:

##### Creating Our Database

```python
from ptdb import createDatabase

myDB = createDatabase('mydatabase') # Creates a new database 'mydatabase' but DOESN'T CREATE A FILE YET.

# I don't like 'mydatabase' for a file name, so I'll change it to 'database' accessing the 'file' property of the Object
myDB.file = 'database'

# Now let's add some content in there (everytime a function that modifies the data in some way, it will save the file (if successful).
myDB.addTitle('ID', 'INT', 'AI') # This create a single column called 'ID' with a type of 'INT' and an attribute of 'AI'

myDB.addTitles(['Name', 'Lastname', 'Email', 'Password', 'Phone'], ['STRING', 'STRING', 'STRING', 'STRING', 'STRING'], ['NONE', 'NONE', 'NONE', 'NONE', 'NULL']) # This method creates all these columns with their respective name, type and attribute

myDB.newEntry(['id', 'name', 'lastname', 'email', 'password'], [0, 'Bryan', 'Morfe', 'bryanmorfe@gmail.com', 'password1'])
# The above method will return False and not create a new entry and will NOT save the file, because the column 'ID' has an attribute of 'AI'

myDB.newEntry(['name', 'lastname', 'email', 'password'], ['Bryan', 'Morfe', 'bryanmorfe@gmail.com', 'password1'])
# This method will work. the column 'ID' is letting its attribute work its magic, and we're not specifying a phone number.

# Let's add a few more entries
myDB.newEntry(['name', 'lastname', 'email', 'password', 'phone'], ['Gabriella', 'Ashton', 'gabriellaashton@gmail.com', 'password2', '9730000000'])
myDB.newEntry(['name', 'lastname', 'email', 'password', 'phone'], ['Bernie', 'Carter', 'berniecarter@gmail.com', 'password3', '9730000000'])
myDB.newEntry(['name', 'lastname', 'email', 'password'], ['Julie', 'Benson', 'juliebenson@gmail.com', 'password4'])
# Those will add all those entries and save the file each time.
```

The resulting file `database` should be defined as follows:
```
[AI]ID(INT) Name Lastname Email Password [NULL]Phone
0 Bryan Morfe bryanmorfe@gmail.com password1 
1 Gabriella Ashton gabriellaashton@gmail.com password2 9730000000
2 Bernie Carter berniecarter@gmail.com password3 9730000000
3 Julie Benson juliebenson@gmail.com password4 
```
The above PTDB database will be used for our following examples.

##### Creating a Simple Login Validator
```python
from ptdb import parse

def login(email, password):
 # Returns true or false whether is logged successfully
 
 # parse the database
 myDB = parse('database')
 
 #Check if email is in database
 if myDB.isItemInColumn('email', email.lower()):
  # If email is in the database, check the password for that entered email.
  
  dbPassword = myDB.getColumnItem('password', myDB.getRowIndex('email', email.lower()) 
  # This above statement is saying; 'Get the password where the column email is 'email.lower()'
  
  # Now we compare the entered password with the one corresponding to that email, if they're equal, the login is successfully, else,    # it's not
  if password == dbPassword:
   return True
  else:
   return False
 else:
  # If email is not in database then return false.
  return False
  
# Now we test the function login.
if login('bryanmorfe@gmail.com', 'password1'):
 print("User logged successfully.")
else:
 print("Credentials are incorrect.")
# Prints 'User logged successfully'
```
##### Modifying the Database Data

For this example, we will simply modify the password in one of our entries.
```python
from ptdb import parse

def changePassword(email, currentPassword, newPassword):
 # This function will return True if we change the password in an entry or false if we couldn't.
 
 # Before anything, we make sure that the currentPassword and the newPassword are different.
 if currentPassword == newPassword:
  return False
  
 # Now, we parse our data
 myDB = parse('database')
 
 # Now we check if the email is in the database
 if myDB.isItemInColumn('email', email.lower()):
  # Now we make sure that the currentPassword matches the one for that email
  dbPassword = myDB.columnItem('password', myDB.getRowIndex('email', email.lower()))
  if dbPassword == currentPassword:
   # If it entered here, then we can change the password.
   myDB.modifyEntry('password', myDB.getRowIndex('email', email.lower()), newPassword)
   # The above method is saying; Replace the column 'Password' with 'newPassword', where the column 'Email', is 'email.lower()' and saves the file
   return True
 else:
  return False
 
if changePassword('gabriellaashton@gmail.com', 'password2', 'P@s5w0rd'):
 print('Password has been changed successfully.')
else:
 print('There was an error changing your password.')
# Prints 'Password has been changed successfully.'
```

After the execution of the above code, our new file should look like this:

```
[AI]ID(INT) Name Lastname Email Password [NULL]Phone
0 Bryan Morfe bryanmorfe@gmail.com password1 
1 Gabriella Ashton gabriellaashton@gmail.com P@s5w0rd 9730000000
2 Bernie Carter berniecarter@gmail.com password3 9730000000
3 Julie Benson juliebenson@gmail.com password4 
```

#### Credits
PTDB: The idea behind PTDB is mine. It created iniatially for personal usage, but then I thought it could be useful for you developers our there too. Although PTDB, as of **now**, has been programmed solely by me, Bryan Morfe,  I do owe a 'Thank you' to a lot of people out the in the internet who have taught me a lot.
